# Project

Our proposed mobile application seeks to revolutionize how TAs, markers, and students interact within the academic environment. It will provide a user-friendly platform for TAs and markers to effortlessly post their availability, work hours, and other relevant information. Simultaneously, students will have access to a comprehensive database of available TA and marker positions, enabling them to apply efficiently. The application will also facilitate seamless communication and collaboration between professors, TAs, and students, promoting an enhanced academic experience.
